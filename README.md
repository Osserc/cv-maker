# CV Maker

This is a React project made as part of the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-cv-application).  
It is meant to be a CV maker app, done by directly editing the fields and adding new ones.

## Warning

Incomplete due to lack of interest. All the functionalities are live, barring the styling, which is atrocious, but the fact that page-break does not get along well with flex and grid is a killjoy.  
Maybe one day I'll revisit this, for now I am content knowing I know how to make a CV app with .pdf generation.
